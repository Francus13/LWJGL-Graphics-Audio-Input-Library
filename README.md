# LWJGL Graphics-and-More Library
Currently, only a 1920x1080 resolution is supported. 

If your graphics card is old, the shaders may not be supported. To fix this, change the versions of the shaders by editing the first line of all .fs and .vs files appropriately. The OpenGL versions can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language.
